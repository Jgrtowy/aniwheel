## Developing üßë‚Äçüíª

Built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), using [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime.

1. Clone the repo.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Jgrtowy/aniwheel.git
```

2. Create new OAuth clients both on [AniList](https://anilist.co/settings/developer) and [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig#_=_) websites.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For MAL set app type to "Other" to ***only*** get client ID. It is necessery to run the app ***without*** the secret which is assigned when selecting other app types.

3. Set their redirect URLs to `http://localhost:3000`.

4. Copy `.env.example` file, rename it to `.env` and fill out all fields.

5. Generate NextAuth secret

```sh
$ openssl rand -base64 32
```

and paste it to `.env` file.

6. Install dependencies

```sh
$ bun i
```

7. Run development server

```sh
$ bun dev
```

And you're ready to go!
